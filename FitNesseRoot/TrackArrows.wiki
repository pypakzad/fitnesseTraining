TrackArrows (the ultimate parent page is HuntTheWumpus)

We are testing how we track arrows throughout HTW.

Testing that the user has all arrows when the game begins:
|At game start|
|check user arrow count|
|user has 5 arrows|

Testing that the arrows move with the user, when the user moves in all directions:
|User is at start|
|Go North|
|Check user arrow count|
|user has 5 arrows|

|User is at start|
|Go South|
|Check user arrow count|
|user has 5 arrows|

|User is at start|
|Go East|
|Check user arrow count|
|user has 5 arrows|

|User is at start|
|Go West|
|Check user arrow count|
|user has 5 arrows|

Testing that the arrow count decreases when the user shoots an arrow:
|User shoots arrow|
|check user arrow count|
|user arrow count decreases by 1|

Testing that the arrow count increases when the user picks up an arrow:
|User picks up arrow|
|check user arrow count|
|user arrow count increases by 1|

Testing that the arrow count does not change when the user shoots and has zero arrows:
|user arrow count is 0|
|user shoots arrow|
|check user arrow count|
|user has 0 arrows|
